 * table, the transport's own framing, the host it binds, the shape of its errors, the
 * `Host` allow-list, and what a shutdown does to a request that is still in flight.
 * This file is that half, and it starts the real entry point as a real child process
 * rather than importing it, because an imported module cannot be given a second port or
 * stopped.
 *
 * The template shipped with no such file, which is why the `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` guard
 * would have landed unverified: nothing here checked the four sample tools, the error
 * mapping, or the header, only that they happened to work over stdio.
 *
 * The last section covers the cluster workers, which is the half of the transport that
 * a single child process cannot see: how many startup lines there are, whether an
 * orphan survives a killed primary, and whether two processes serving the same port
 * keep each other's requests straight.
