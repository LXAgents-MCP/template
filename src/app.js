 * This module builds an express app and returns it. **It does not listen** —
 * `src/index.js` owns the port, and after the cluster change the worker count too. A
 * file that both builds the app and binds a port cannot be reasoned about, or tested,
 * without binding one, and every assertion about the routes in here is made by starting
 * the real entry point as a child process.
 *
 * The surface is deliberately narrow: `POST /mcp` and `GET /healthz`, a JSON-RPC 404
 * for everything else, and a 405 for any other method on `/mcp`. Nothing here is a
 * second source of truth about the tool list — `createServer()` is the same factory
 * `src/index.js` uses on stdio, and it returns a fresh `McpServer` per call, so each
 * request gets its own. Sharing one across requests would be a real bug: `McpServer`
 * holds per-connection state.
 */

 * would have started unguarded. The task record for the migration says so in the same
 * words; see `.agents/memory/tasks/express-cluster-migration.md`. The matching code is
 * deliberately identical to the siblings', because a template that ships a *different*
 * guard is a template that ships a guard nobody has reviewed.
 *
 * Unset — or set to nothing but commas and spaces — means the check is skipped rather
 * than guessed at. An allow-list that silently refuses every request is a worse failure
